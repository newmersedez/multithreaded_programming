Multiplexing is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are
combined into one signal over a shared medium.

				Multiplexing methods

1) select

>>> struct fd_set - set of sockets(block of memory with size = 1024
	=> max socket fd = 1023)
	disadvantage of this method: C10K and C100K errors

>>> FD_ZERO(&set) - macros which fills struct fields with default values(0)

>>> FD_SET(masterSocket, &set) - macros which set master socket
	In this cycle we add all slave sockets into out set
	for (every slave)
	{
		FD_SET(slave, &set) - 
	}
Then find maximum slave fd so that server knows the boundary
	int MAX = (...)

>>> select(MAX + 1, &set, NULL, NULL, NULL);
	1 param - Max size fd + 1
	2 param - fd which server listening for reading
	3 param - fd which server listening for writing
	4 param - error
	5 param - timeout

	Then:
	for (every slave)
	{
		if (FD_ISSET(slave, &set))
		{
			...
		}
	}
	if (FD_ISSET(masterSocket, &set))
	{
		accept(...);
	}
